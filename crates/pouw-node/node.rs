//! The node loop: one thread owns the whole [`NodeState`] and handles one [`Event`]
//! at a time. Every other component runs on its own thread and feeds the loop through
//! one bounded channel per class of producer ([`Feeds`] sends, [`Inbox`] receives).
//! Commands to the transport, gossip verdicts and sync answers among them, go out
//! through [`Network`]; an API caller gets its answer through the oneshot sender in its
//! request ([`reply_to`] counts the ones nobody waits for).

//!
//! The work worker has one job at a time (see the `miner` module): the loop picks the
//! next one when the worker is free, a received block to verify first, then a proof,
//! then a range of nonces. Received blocks wait in `Work::verify_queue`, which holds
//! `VERIFY_QUEUE_CAP` blocks, and a block that finds it full is dropped and counted in
//! `Metrics::dropped_blocks`.
//!
//! Select priority, highest first: control, work, the tick deadline, p2p, api. The
//! loop thread owns a current-thread tokio runtime and waits on all the receivers at
//! once in [`next_event`], which polls them in that order, so a flood on a lower
//! channel never delays a shutdown, a finished proof or the tick. The tick ranks above
//! p2p and api because it fires once per [`TICK_INTERVAL`] (a late tick is skipped, never
//! queued) and starving it would stall mining and the gauges. The loop never blocks on a
//! full command channel: a transport that is stuck on a full p2p channel could otherwise
//! wait for a loop that waits for the transport.
//!
//! Errors: a handler returns `Result<(), NodeFault>` and [`run`] stops on the first
//! `Err`. A fault is never a verdict on a peer, a transaction or a block: a rule
//! violation is a typed outcome ([`TxOutcome`], [`BlockOutcome`]), a failed store, a
//! gone thread or an exhausted counter is a [`NodeFault`]. [`run`] returns `Ok` only
//! for [`Control::Shutdown`], which the signal thread sends on SIGINT and SIGTERM. Each
//! component thread ends with [`Control::Stopped`]; one that ends with an error is a
//! fault of the node.

/// To build:
/// 1. Each header after the first has the id of the one before as parent; a break is
///    [`Misbehavior::InvalidBlock`] for `peer` (see [`report`]).
/// 2. Pass each header in order to [`chain::receive_header`]. `Known` is skipped,
///    `Stored` is kept for step 4, `Invalid` is [`Misbehavior::InvalidBlock`] and ends the
///    answer. `UnknownParent` on the first header means the peer ignored our locator, and
///    is [`Misbehavior::InvalidBlock`] too.
/// 3. A full answer of [`MAX_HEADERS_PER_RESPONSE`](p2p::limits::MAX_HEADERS_PER_RESPONSE) headers means more follow: ask again
///    with `sync::ask_headers`, whose locator now starts at the stored headers.
/// 4. Fetch bodies only once the cumulative work of the last stored header
///    ([`IndexEntry::work`](store::schema::IndexEntry::work)) reaches `state.min_chain_work`, so a long chain of
///    little work costs no downloads. Then ask for the bodies whose block is not stored,
///    in height order, with `sync::request` and a [`SyncRequest::GetBlocks`] of at most
///    [`MAX_BLOCKS_PER_REQUEST`](p2p::limits::MAX_BLOCKS_PER_REQUEST) ids. Keep one window in flight per peer and never ask
///    two peers for the same id; the window bookkeeping is a new plain field of
///    [`NodeState`].
/// 5. The bodies come back as a `Blocks` answer to [`on_response`] and connect through
///    [`connect_synced`], the verify queue and `chain::receive_block`. When a window is answered, ask the
///    next one.
/// 6. `state.assume_valid`: for its ancestors the verify-work stage
///    (`miner::verify_work`, which holds the Groth16 payload verify) may
///    be skipped, as Bitcoin's `assumevalid` skips script checks. Header, target,
///    timestamp and linking rules (step 2) and the other body rules still run for
///    every block.
///
/// Limits: one `GetHeaders` and one window per peer at a time, and a peer that does not
/// answer in time is [`Misbehavior::Unresponsive`].
///
/// Test: a node that starts empty with one peer that holds a chain of 5000 blocks
