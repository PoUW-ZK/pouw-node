//! Block production and the work worker, so searching, proving and work checks never
//! block the loop.
//!
//! # The work worker
//!
//! One thread owns the [`Prover`] and runs every [`WorkJob`] the loop hands it:
//! [`WorkJob::SearchNonce`] tries a range of nonces, [`WorkJob::Prove`] makes a proof
//! and [`WorkJob::VerifyWork`] checks the work claim of a received block. The answer is
//! a [`WorkDone`] on the work channel.
//!
//! One job is in flight at a time, and the loop owns that fact: [`Work::in_flight`]
//! names the job from `send` until its [`WorkDone`] is handled. The loop sends a job
//! on the jobs channel (capacity [`JOBS_CAPACITY`](crate::node::JOBS_CAPACITY)) and the
//! worker answers on the work channel (capacity
//! [`WORK_CAPACITY`](crate::node::WORK_CAPACITY)), which the loop reads second, after
//! control. Because the loop sends no second job before the first result is handled,
//! neither channel can overflow: the worker blocks on a send that has room.
//!
//! When the worker is free, [`dispatch`] picks the next job by priority: a received
//! block to verify, then a proof for a pending request, then a nonce range of the block
//! template.
//!
//! # Mining
//!
//! The consensus of header v1 is hash proof of work, so a block needs no proof tx and
//! mining never waits for a request. A proof is a fee-paying payload: while a request
//! is pending and no proof is held, the worker proves it, and the finished proof is
//! kept in [`Work::held`] until the next template takes it. The proof binds the parent
//! and the coin transactions of its block through eta, so the held proof carries the
//! exact transactions it was made for. It is dropped when the tip moves or its request
//! leaves the mempool. A request whose proof failed, or whose circuit the chain does
//! not know, is set aside in [`Work::skipped`] until the tip changes, so one bad
//! request does not keep the worker from searching.
//!
//! The template ([`Template`]) is the coin transactions by fee rate ([`candidate`]) and
//! at most the held proof. It is rebuilt when the tip changes, when the held proof
//! appears or goes, when the mempool has grown and [`TEMPLATE_REFRESH_SECS`] passed
//! since the build, and when the nonce range is exhausted (the timestamp moves on). The
//! header takes its target and timestamp floor from [`chain::child_rules`], the code
//! that checks the header of a received block, and its timestamp from the clock of the
//! node, at least the median time past plus one.
//!
//! A search job covers [`SEARCH_BATCH`] nonces. On a found nonce [`on_nonce`] encodes
//! the block, runs `precheck::check_block` and `chain::receive_block`, and announces the
//! header with `p2p::Gossip::Announce`. Peers fetch the body with `GetBlocks`.
//!
//! The account model has no coinbase transaction: when a block connects, the reward
//! `subsidy(height)` plus the fees of the block is credited to `header.miner` by
//! `pouw_consensus::apply_block`, which is part of the pouw-node#77 spec.
//!
//! # Verify-work
//!
//! The work claim of a block is checked by [`pouw_consensus::verify_pow`]. In header v1
//! it is the cheap header check that the precheck runs already. A version whose claim is
//! costly to check leaves it out of the precheck, and received blocks reach the worker
//! through [`Work::verify_queue`], a queue of [`VERIFY_QUEUE_CAP`] blocks. A block that
//! finds the queue full is dropped and counted in `Metrics::dropped_blocks`, its peer
//! is not penalised. Blocks arrive only as answers to `GetBlocks` ([`enqueue_verify`]
//! is called from `node::connect_synced`).
