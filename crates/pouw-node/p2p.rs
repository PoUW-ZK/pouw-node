//! The boundary between the node and its peer-to-peer transport: the messages, the
//! topics and the two directions of calls. The transport (libp2p gossipsub and
//! request-response) owns the receiving end of a [`Network`] handle and sends the node
//! [`Inbound`] messages. Messages are borsh, like everything else on the wire.
//!
//! The transport thread owns [`Transport`]: the table of connected peers, their
//! scores and the counters that number gossip messages and served requests. The node
//! never sees a [`PeerId`]: it names a peer by the [`PeerIx`] the transport assigned on
//! connect, and every [`Command`] about a peer carries that index.
//!
//! ```text
//!  swarm (pouw-node#85) -- Wire (WIRE_CAPACITY) --> transport thread
//!                                                    |  decode, number, map PeerId to PeerIx
//!                                                    v
//!                          node loop <-- Inbound (P2P_CAPACITY, `send().await`)
//!                          node loop --> Command (COMMAND_CAPACITY, try_send) --> transport
//! ```
//!
//! Backpressure: the transport awaits a free slot of the p2p channel before it reads
//! the next [`Wire`] message, so a slow node slows the reads of the swarm (the libp2p
//! swarm of pouw-node#85 stops polling its sockets while that await is pending). The
//! node never awaits the transport: a full command channel drops the command and counts
//! it in `Metrics::dropped_commands`.
