//! The PoUW-ZK full node: everything around consensus that a running process needs.
//! Consensus rules are in `pouw_consensus`, proving backends behind
//! `pouw_provers::Prover`, and the API types in `pouw_api`; this crate wires them
//! to storage, the mempool, the network, the event log and the metrics. The loop that
//! owns all of it is [`node::run`].
