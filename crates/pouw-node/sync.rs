//! Chain sync over [`SyncRequest`] and [`SyncResponse`]: answering the requests of
//! peers from the store, and asking peers for headers and blocks. A request of the node
//! is sent with a [`RequestId`] and kept in a table of pending requests until the
//! transport answers it with that id. Headers-first initial block download is
//! pouw-node#90, built on these requests in `node::on_headers`.
//!
//! ```text
//!  Status of a peer with more work   -> ask_headers   GetHeaders { our locator }
//!  announce, parent not indexed      -> ask_headers
//!  announce, parent indexed          -> chain::receive_header, ask_block id
//!  Headers answer                    -> node::on_headers (pouw-node#90)
//!  Blocks answer                     -> chain pipeline, in order
//! ```
//!
//! A locator lists ids of the canonical chain from the tip down: the last
//! [`DENSE_LOCATOR_IDS`] heights one by one, then steps that double, and always the genesis
//! as the last id. The answering node takes the first id it has on its canonical chain
//! as the fork point and sends the headers after it, so two nodes on different forks
//! find their common ancestor in one round trip with at most [`MAX_LOCATOR_IDS`] ids.
