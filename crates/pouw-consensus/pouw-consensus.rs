//! Consensus of PoUW-ZK as pure functions: the chain state and its diffs,
//! the validity rules of `contracts/block.md`, and the research
//! seams: proof of work (`pow`), target (`difficulty`), timestamp, fork choice,
//! subsidy (`reward`) and the state transition of a block (`transition`). Nothing
//! here does I/O, reads a clock or spawns a task, so every node computes the same
//! result from the same inputs and every rule is testable without a node.
